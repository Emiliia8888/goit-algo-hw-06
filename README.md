## Task Two - conclusion:
DFS explores deeply along one departmental branch before considering others, while BFS systematically examines all systems at increasing distances from the gateway, reaching critical infrastructure sooner.

Even when BFS and DFS return the same solution path, BFS typically explores fewer nodes because it expands the search frontier level by level and terminates as soon as the goal is reached, whereas DFS may explore deep but irrelevant branches before backtracking.
